# Flappy-Bird

This is a game coded in Java, which contrains all the functions of the original Flappy Bird game and I have added few new functions such as the double player mode and the coin 

element

In my program, the coin sometimes appears at weird location, but this situation is very rare

Moreover, as the game keeps going, the gaps between the up and down pupes become smaller and smaller

When the bird gets the coin, the score does not add up but the size of the bird would become smaller
